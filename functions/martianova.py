Baseline correction using adaptive iteratively reweighted penalized least squares

This program is a translation in python of the R source code of airPLS version 2.0
by Yizeng Liang and Zhang Zhimin - https://code.google.com/p/airpls

Reference:
Z.-M. Zhang, S. Chen, and Y.-Z. Liang, Baseline correction using adaptive iteratively 
reweighted penalized least squares. Analyst 135 (5), 1138-1146 (2010).

Description from the original documentation:
Baseline drift always blurs or even swamps signals and deteriorates analytical 
results, particularly in multivariate analysis.  It is necessary to correct baseline 
drift to perform further data analysis. Simple or modified polynomial fitting has 
been found to be effective in some extent. However, this method requires user 
intervention and prone to variability especially in low signal-to-noise ratio 
environments. The proposed adaptive iteratively reweighted Penalized Least Squares
(airPLS) algorithm doesn't require any user intervention and prior information, 
such as detected peaks. It iteratively changes weights of sum squares errors (SSE) 
between the fitted baseline and original signals, and the weights of SSE are obtained 
adaptively using between previously fitted baseline and original signals. This 
baseline estimator is general, fast and flexible in fitting baseline.
